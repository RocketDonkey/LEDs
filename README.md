# LEDs

Some very basic script(s) for tinkering with LEDs. This started during Christmas
when it was decided that our tree was not festive enough, so rather than get
a commercial controller that would provide far more options in a far more
elegant way, I decided it would be better to apply my complete lack of design
sense and make my own.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the library that does the real work:

```
sudo pip install rpi_ws281x
```

At some point this should include how to wire everything up, but I am the only
person who will ever read this and I have the notes stored elsewhere. Which begs
the question - why am I writing this? TODO: Add that to the TODO list.

## TODO
> Note: These will almost certainly never be done.
* Add wiring diagram for the circuit
* Add more information about the hardware
* Figure out who is reading this / why
